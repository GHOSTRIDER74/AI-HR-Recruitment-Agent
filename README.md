An intelligent recruitment assistant that automates the resume screening process using Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) that rely on simple keyword matching, this agent utilizes **Google Gemini** to semantically understand candidate profiles, compare them against Job Descriptions (JDs), and provide reasoned decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **📄 PDF Resume Parsing:** Robust text extraction from PDF documents using `pypdf`.
* **🧠 Context-Aware Analysis:** Uses the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model to evaluate candidates based on skills, experience, and potential fit, providing a match score (0-100%).
* **👮 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** A critical verification layer where a human recruiter reviews the AI's decision before finalization, ensuring fairness and accuracy.
* **📧 Automated Communication:** Generates professional, context-specific email drafts (Interview Invitations or Rejections) based on the final decision.
* **⚡ Portable Design:** Built with relative paths to run seamlessly on any local machine or cloud environment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **LLM:** Google Gemini API (`google-generativeai`)
* **PDF Processing:** `pypdf`
* **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`
* **Data Handling:** `pandas` (optional for future expansion)
